## What is Meshery 
A service mesh playground to faciliate learning about functionality and performance of different service meshes. 
Meshery incorporates the collection and display of metrics from applications running in the playground. 
Meshery Provides these features below as part of it's playground.

1. the user interface to authenticate users.
1. accepts and maintains the Kubernetes cluster config and context.
1. enables users to generate load against their applications.
1. collects the results of the performance tests from its load generator (Fortio) and stores in the cloud for historical viewing.
1. interfaces with the Meshery adapters dynamically and enables users to play with service mesh.

## What challenges does Meshery solve. (adoption and ongoing management)
Meshery is intended to be a vendor and project-neutral utility for uniformly benchmarking the performance of service meshes. 
Between service mesh and proxy projects (and surprisingly, within a single project), a number of different tools and results exist. 
Meshery allows you to pick an efficient set of tools for your ecosystem by providing performance evaluation and metrics

1. By leveraging Meshery you could achieve apples-to-apples performance comparision of Service Meshes
1. Track your service mesh performance from release to release.
1. Understand behavioral differences between service meshes.
1. Track your application performance from version to version.
