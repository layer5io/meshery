### Features
1. Lifecycle management of Istio
1. SMI Conformance Capability
1. Lifecycle management of sample applications
1. Configuration best practices
1. Custom service mesh configuration
1. Prometheus and Grafana connections

### Lifecycle management

The {{page.name}} can install **{{page.version}}** of the {{page.name}} service mesh. The SMI adapter for Istio can also be installed using Meshery.

### SMI Conformance Capability

### Conformance

Defining “Conformance” - It’s important to acknowledge that conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status. We define conformance as a combination of these two concepts.

1. SMI Conformance acknowledges that
   ...some participating service meshes may conscientiously never fully implement functions (SMI specs)...

2. SMI Conformance identifies
   ...a difference between full implementation of a specification and compliance with the portions that it implements...

### Capability

Given that some service mesh implementations, never intend to fully implement the SMI specifications, for each individual test, three possible capability designations exist

- Full - service mesh has this capability

- Partial - service mesh has a portion of this capability implemented(may or may not have this full capability in the future)

- None - currently service mesh does not have this capability (may or may not have this capability in the future).


### Sample applications

The ({{ page.name }}) includes a handful of sample applications. Use Meshery to deploy any of these sample applications:

- [Bookinfo](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/bookinfo)
- [Httpbin](https://httpbin.org/)
- [Hipster](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)

Once BookInfo is deployed, you can use Meshery to apply configuration to control traffic, inject latency, perform context-based routing, and so on.

### Configuration best practices
The {{page.name}} will parse all of Istio's configuration and compare the running configuration of the service mesh against known best practices for an {{page.title}} deployment.

### Custom service mesh configuration

Meshery allows you to paste (or type in) any Kubernetes manifest that you would like to have applied to the cluster. This configuraiton may be new VirtualServices or new DestinationRules or other.

### Prometheus and Grafana connections

The {{page.name}} will connect to Istio's Prometheus and Grafana instances running in the control plane (typically found in the `istio-system` namespace). You can also connect Meshery to Prometheus and Grafana instances not running in the service mesh's control plane.
