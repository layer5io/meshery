### SMI Conformance Capability

### Conformance

Defining "Conformance" - It is important to acknowledge that conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status. We define conformance as a combination of these two concepts.

1. SMI Conformance acknowledges that
   ...some participating service meshes may conscientiously never fully implement functions (SMI specs)...

2. SMI Conformance identifies
   ...a difference between full implementation of a specification and compliance with the portions that it implements...
