These guidelines are a collection of principles and conventions that need to be followed while designing mesheryctl commands.

## Principles

### Intuition vs Consistency

Commands should be designed in such a way that they are intuitive. Users should ideally be able to understand what a command is used for without having to extensively go through the documentation.

For example, `mesheryctl pattern apply -f <pattern name>` requires no further clarification as it is evident that the command will apply the pattern specified.

Consistency is key when designing intuitive interfaces. Although `mesheryctl perf run -f <performance profile name>` may sound more intuitive, users who are experienced in using the CLI will prefer the consistant verb `apply` over `run`.

This will also ensure a consistent command language making memorizing easier.

Consistency should also be enforced when chaining commands and using flags.

For example, if `mesheryctl pattern` has a `list` and `view` command and has an `-all` and `--output` flag, then, similar commands like `mesheryctl perf` should also support the same commands and flags and provide a consistent user experience.

### Rational defaults overriden with flags

Default behaviour should be optimised for what users will need to do most of the time.

These assumed defaults should be easily overriden by the user with flags.

For example, `mesheryctl system context create <context name>` assumes a default platform for the created context. But this can be easily overriden with the `--platform` flag.

### GUI vs CLI

For all the functionalities in mesheryctl, it is safe to assume that the CLI should provide the same user experience as it does in the GUI unless it is explicitly specified.

For example, viewing a performance profile in the GUI and with `mesheryctl system perf view <profile name>` in the CLI should show the same data.

### Reduce user effort

CLI is not as visually intuitive as GUIs which makes it difficult for the user to interact with it.

To make it easy and reduce the amount of effort needed for the user, the following should be taken care of-

* Provide only relevant output. Use "debug" logs that can be accessed with `--verbose` flag wherever needed.
* Add headers to output to give context to the user.
* As mentioned [above](#intuition-vs-consistency), similar commands should behave similarly.
* Confirm steps for risky commands. For example, use the `AskForConfirmation` function which will prompt the user to type in "yes" or "no" to continue.
* Anticipate user actions. If the user creates a new context with `mesheryctl system context create` then the next action might be `mesheryctl system start` to start Meshery ot `mesheryctl system context switch` to switch context names.
* Anticipate user errors. For example, if the user types in `mesheryctl system satrt`, using the inbuilt features with the [cobra library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), we can correct it to `start` and alert the user.

## Process

When designing for the CLI, consider:

### What the command does

What makes sense to do from a terminal? What doesnâ€™t?
What might people want to automate?
What is the default behavior? What flags might you need to change that behavior?
What might people try and fail to do and how can you anticipate that?

### What the command is called

What should be the command language? (`mesheryctl <command> <subcommand> [args] [flags] [value]`)
What should be a command vs a flag?
How can you align the language of the new command with the existing commands?

### What the command outputs

How can you make the GUI and the CLI outputs similar?
What should be outputted normally and what falls into debug logs?

### How you explain your command

You will need to provide a short and long description of the command for the help pages and also for the Meshery Documentation.

## Creating design specifications

If you are working on a new command or adding a new feature on an existing command, it is recommended to setup a design spec so that other contributors can weigh in on the design before you start to code.

Broader features should have a design spec made in Google Doc using [this template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KHtJc4ToklBQ_UUsDgAL2sVZNhOQGzbh).

For small changes, communicating over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/issues) or the [discussions](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/discussions) will be helpful.
